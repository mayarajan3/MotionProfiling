  Generating a set of distances, velocities, and accelerations for a robot moving in a unidirectional path
  Given: a distance
  
2D Motion Profiling Constructor:
  Generating a set of distances, velocities, and accelerations for each side of the robot
  Given: a start and end point using spline interpolation
